# The (incomplete) curcuma Changelog

### pre Alpha
- add reordering for non-conformer/non-isomer structures
- find more or less unique conformers in trajectories
- scan xyz files (trajectories) for hbonds and prints each single distance for each step
- include optional XTB
- prepare NEB input geometries (reordered and aligned)
- add -led option to prepare fragment assigned xyz files (for ORCA LED calculation)
- Add conformation filter (energy, rmsd, rank) - with automatic/forced reordering of structures
- Reorder atom indicies in molecule, keeping methyl connectivitiy
- Initial docking
- Calculate RMSD for two molecules
